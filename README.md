# DiceGame

* The purpose of this project is to improve my JS skills, particularly when it comes to DOM manipulation.

* The game consists of 2 players rolling a dice. Each time the dice is rolled the active can keep playing or choose to "hold" the sum of the numbers the dice has "given".

* If the dice rolls a "1", the active player will lose the score of the current round and the other player will start another round.

* The project is still unfinished.
